The purpose of the project is to monitor the air quality conditions in an office.

So far we have linked a Carbon Monoxide Sensor to an arduino and read the output values. We have used the following tutorial in order to get things running: http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/MQ-7-carbon-monoxide-sensor-circuit-with-arduino.php and ...

The sensors send their data to an Arduino in analog format.

After that the arduino sends through serial communication the sensor data to the RBP that exposes an API.
